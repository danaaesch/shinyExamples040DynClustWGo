# shinyExamples040DynClustWGo
Improved clone of shiny-examples/tree/main/040-dynamic-clustering. After initial clustering, any points which are added have pch=1 and col='black'. If clustering has already been done, text appears in the plot stating added that 'Go' needs to be clicked to incorporate these new points.
